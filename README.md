# Yoga API üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Yoga API will serve you yoga categories and postures. This documentation should help you use the endpoints with HTTP requests. At the moment 12 categories and 48 postures can be requested. 

This is a work in progress, be aware your response can look different. This is because changes can be made over time. 

## Why Yoga Poses ?

After Heroku policy changes around November, some active API about yoga went down. Currently, I am taking the data in some developed projects.
