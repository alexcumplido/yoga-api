# Yoga API üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Currently, 12 categories and around 50 postures can be found. If your response looks different, it is normal. This is a work in progress and modifications will be made. This API is deployed live at [Render](https://render.com/).

After Heroku policy changes around November 2022, the main APIs providing data about yoga stopped working. I am plugging data from some of those projects into this one creating new endpoints.

## How can I use this API?

**Request base URL:**

```
https://yoga-api-nzy4.onrender.com/api/yoga
```

**Response :**

```
HTTP 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "baseURL": "https://yoga-api-nzy4.onrender.com/api/yoga/",
    "categories": "https://yoga-api-nzy4.onrender.com/api/yoga/categories/",
    "category": "https://yoga-api-nzy4.onrender.com/api/yoga/category/:categoryName/",
    "poses": "https://yoga-api-nzy4.onrender.com/api/yoga/poses/",
    "posture": "https://yoga-api-nzy4.onrender.com/api/yoga/pose/:poseName/"
}

```

The base URL is the root of the URL. If you ever make a request and you get back a 404 NOT FOUND response, then check the base URL first.
