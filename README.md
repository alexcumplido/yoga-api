# Yoga API üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Yoga API serves categories and yoga poses upon HTTP request. The API is hosted in [Render](https://render.com/). This documentation should help you use the endpoints. Currently, 12 categories and 48 postures can be requested. 

## Why Yoga Poses ?

After Heroku policy changes around November 2022 some working APIs providing data about yoga went down. To keep offering a reliable API I am pluging data from some of these projects into Yoga Api.

## How can I use it?

Base URL for Yoga API is:

```
https://yoga-api-nzy4.onrender.com/api/yoga
```

```
HTTP 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "categories": "https://yoga-api-nzy4.onrender.com/api/yoga/categories",
    "category": "https://yoga-api-nzy4.onrender.com/api/yoga/categories/core yoga poses",  
    "poses": "https://yoga-api-nzy4.onrender.com/api/yoga/poses", 
    "posture": "https://yoga-api-nzy4.onrender.com/api/yoga/poses/boat", 
}
```
The base url is the root of the url, if you ever make a request and you get back a 404 NOT FOUND response then check the Base URL first.
